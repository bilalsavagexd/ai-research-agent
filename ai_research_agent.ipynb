The procedure involves stopping the cluster balancer. If your system configuration allows file system backups, this might be more efficient than using MongoDB tools.\\n\\nCreate backups using `mongodump` to back up each component in the cluster individually.\\n\\nCreate backups using `mongodump` to back up each component in the cluster individually.\\n\\nLimit the operation of the cluster balancer to provide a window for regular backup operations.\\n\\nAn outline of the procedure and consideration for restoring an *entire* sharded cluster from backup.\\n\\n# Configuration and Maintenance\\n\\nThis section describes routine management operations, including updating your MongoDB deployment's configuration.\\n\\nOutlines common MongoDB configurations and examples of best-practice configurations for common use cases.\\n\\nUpgrade a MongoDB deployment to a different patch release within the same major release series.\\n\\nStart, configure, and manage running `mongod` process.\\n\\nStop in progress MongoDB client operations using `db.killOp()` and `maxTimeMS()`.\\n\\nArchive the current log files and start new ones.\\n\\n## Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture\\n\\nTo help MongoDB engineers analyze server behavior, `mongod` and `mongos` processes include a Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture (FTDC) mechanism. FTDC is enabled by default. Due to its importance in debugging deployments, FTDC thread failures are fatal and stop the parent `mongod` or `mongos` process.\\n\\nFTDC data files are compressed and not human-readable. They inherit the same file access permissions as the MongoDB data files. Only users with access to FTDC data files can transmit the FTDC data.\\n\\nMongoDB engineers cannot access FTDC data without explicit permission and assistance from system owners or operators.\\n\\nFTDC data **never** contains any of the following information:\\n\\n- Samples of queries, query predicates, or query results\\n\\n- Data sampled from any end-user collection or index\\n\\n- System or MongoDB user credentials or security certificates\\n\\n# Create a MongoDB Deployment\\n\\nYou can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas to store and manage your data.
